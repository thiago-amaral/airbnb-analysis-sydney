## Sydney Airbnb Analysis

In this project, an exploratory data analysis was done using an Airbnb dataset for the app's listings in the city of Sydney, Australia. Some interesting insights could be extracted from the data such as what locations are more expensive and what type of property rental is more sought-after in Sydney.
